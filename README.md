# Docker Container for Mercator 

This Projects provides a couple of scripts to build and run it Mercator inside a docker container.

## Mercator: Spatial Index

**Mercator** is a spatial *volumetric* index for the [Human Brain Project](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu). It is a component of the [Knowledge Graph](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search/) service, which  provides the spatial anchoring for the metadata registered as well as processes the volumetric queries.

It is build on top of the Iron Sea database toolkit.

## Iron Sea: Database Toolkit

**Iron Sea** provides a set of database engine bricks, which can be combined and applied on arbitrary data structures.

Unlike a traditional database, it does not assume a specific physical structure for the tables nor the records, but relies on the developper to provide a set of extractor functions which are used by the specific indices provided.

This enables the index implementations to be agnostic from the underlying data structure, and re-used.

## Requirements

### Software

 * docker
 * git

## Quick start

1. **Building the container image**
	
	Clone the mercator workspace to a folder named `mercator` in the current directory, then use: 
	
	```sh
	./build.sh
	```

2. **Starting the container**
	
	```sh
	# ./run.sh <docker-compose commands>
	./run.sh up -d # to run the service as a deamon
	```

### Usage

You can customize a set of parameters with environment variables. To retrieve a full list of these, please take a look at `settings.default.sh`.

You can either overrides in the environment by exporting them before calling `run.sh`, adding them on the command line. For example: 

```sh
KG_SPATIAL_SEARCH_PORT="80" ./run.sh up -d
```

You can also override variables by setting them in `settings.local.sh`. It is recommanded to use the same format as the one foudn in `settings.default.sh` as this allows one-off overrides from the command line or environment.
